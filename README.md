GPT Based Smart Assistant
Project Overview
The GPT Based Smart Assistant is an interactive, voice-controlled assistant built using OpenAI’s powerful GPT language model. Its primary goal is to offer a natural and intuitive conversational experience by understanding spoken queries and responding with meaningful, context-aware answers.

Features
Voice Command Capture: Listens to user speech through a microphone.

Speech-to-Text Conversion: Converts audio input into text using speech recognition technology.

GPT-Powered Processing: Sends the transcribed text to OpenAI’s ChatGPT API for intelligent, context-driven responses.

Text-to-Speech Output: Converts GPT-generated responses back into natural speech, enabling seamless voice interaction.

Natural Language Understanding: Capable of handling a wide range of queries and commands in everyday language.

How It Works
User speaks a command or question into the microphone.

The system converts the speech to text.

The text input is sent to the GPT model for processing.

GPT generates a relevant and coherent response.

The response is converted back to audio and played aloud to the user.

Benefits
Hands-free operation for multitasking and accessibility.

Enhanced user engagement with natural, conversational AI.

Extensible framework for adding new voice-driven capabilities.
